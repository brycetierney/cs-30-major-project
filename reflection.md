If I were starting over, I'd break things into smaller parts for easier management and handle errors more gracefully like with user inputs.

Unfortunately I did not at all. This was all extremely hard and I feel like i just completely biffed this in every way possible. I wasnt able to start on plinko and i wouldve had to use p5play for that so i should have kept it simple with just one game. Mines was also a lot harder than i thought and i guess coding a whole game would never really be easy so I should have left more time for that.

The hardest part of the project was trying to make anything work at all. Limbo's randomizer was very hard to figure out and there wasnt much info on how it really worked so the logic was hard to code.

There were so many problems I couldnt solve for a while and others that didnt even get fixed. When the randomizer in limbo was above the target multiplier, it would just keep on bringing the bank balance up at very high speeds.
Theres also a weird bug where neither the plinko and mines games exist, unfortunately I couldnt figure out how to fix this problem.

Overall I dont think this is a very functional game but it was the hardest code I have ever written and probably the most amount of time I've ever spent on a project that when I was done, barely worked.
