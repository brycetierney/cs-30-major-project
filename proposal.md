# Major Project Proposal

## Description
What am I going to build?
- Online casino game center

## Needs to Have List
- Home screen where you can choose which game you would like to play
- (All games will need:
1. Input for bet amount, button next to bet to multiply bet by 1/2 or 2(half the bet or double the bet))
- Games include hi-lo, plinko and mines
- Limbo:
- Need to create input for the: 
Bet amount
Target multilpier you want to be the minimum number that the random number must be for the bet to win. ie: if the random number generated is above your chosen number, the bet amount is multiplied by a certain amount based on how likely it is to be above your chosen number.
- A randomizer for picking a number from 1.01 (super likely), 10.00 (super rare to go this high)
- Plinko: Need to use p5play for "gravity"
- Mines game (simplier one):
Make a 2d grid that randomly spawns

- Sound effects

## Nice to Have List
- Graph showing your gain/loss of money
- Bank account amount, universal between games(not real money)
