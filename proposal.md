# Major Project Proposal

## Description
What am I going to build?
- Online casino game center

## Needs to Have List
- Home screen where you can choose which game you would like to play
- All games will need:
1. Input for bet amount, button next to bet amount to multiply it by 1/2 or 2
- Games include hi-lo, plinko and mines
- Limbo:
- Need to create input for the: 
Bet amount
Target multilpier you want to be the minimum number that the random number must be for the bet to win. ie: if the random number generated is above your chosen number, the bet amount is multiplied by a certain amount based on how likely it is to be above your chosen number.
- A randomizer for picking a random number. (Higher the number, lower the chance and higher the multiplier)
- Plinko: Need to use p5play for "gravity"
- Mines game:
Make a 2d grid that spawns the amount of mines selected by user input throughout the grid
Every tile will be covered by a black sticker type thing
Once you click a tile, either a gem or mine will be revealed
If the tile reveals a gem:
    the bet multiplier (payout) will increase exponentially
If the tile reveals a mine:
    You lose your original bet amount and all the tiles are revealed


- Sound effects

## Nice to Have List
- Graph showing your gain/loss of money
- Bank account amount, universal between games(not real money)
